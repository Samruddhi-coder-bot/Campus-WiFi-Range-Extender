# 🛰️ Campus Wi-Fi Range Extender Placement

### 🎯 Objective
Optimize router placement to provide full Wi-Fi coverage across hostels using:
- Greedy Set Cover Algorithm
- Dynamic Programming (Bitmask Optimization)

### 🧮 Use Cases
1. Minimize routers needed  
2. Handle dynamic user loads (can extend coverage radius)  
3. Compare performance between Greedy and DP  

### ⚙️ Technologies
- Language: C  
- Libraries: `math.h`, `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`

### 🧩 How to Run
```bash
gcc wifi_router_placement.c -o wifi
./wifi
